# Indie Web APP

## Current Status
Currently the main page has mock data for produt items as an example only. The integration with the BE is not yet done so all data in the app or storybook is mocked.

[TODO list](./docs/todo.md)

## Development Process

This application is being built first on storybook. Each Component is created and a test case is added to storybook.
Whenever deemed appropriate, the component will be added to the main application.

For this reason, the storybook will always have more components than the actual application.

## Quick-start

Install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


Install all dependencies by running
```bash
npm install
```

Run the project locally
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Run the storybook
```bash
npm run start:dev
```
